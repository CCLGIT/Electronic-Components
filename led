An LED (light emitting diode) is a semi-conductor light source that emits light when electricity current flows through it. Available in various colours, 
LED only allows electricity to flow only in one direction ie. they are polarized components. Each LED has two legs - the longer leg is the anode (+ve)
while the other shorter leg is the cathode (-ve).
The anode is connected to power while the cathode is connected to ground.
